## Spoilers ahead

Somehow I've managed to avoid this critically acclaimed game for this long, but last week I found it on sale for 29,90. With my game backlog emptied for [No Man's Sky](http://www.no-mans-sky.com), I figured this would fill the gap nicely. Here are some thoughts after finishing the game in around 12 hours of play-time spread over 5 days.

### The game in a nutshell

The Last of Us Remastered is an upgraded version of the original PS3 game, optimized for 1080p60 for the Playstation 4. It's a Naughty Dog game, so it's very similar in style and gameplay to the Uncharted series. By similar, I mean it's probably got the same game engine, and definitely the same protagonist model, just a bit older and wiser. In The Last of Us you are Joel, a man trying to survive in a world after the zombie apocalypse. A young girl named Ellie tags along, and together you must go cross-county. When I say must, I mean that this game is a linear action game, and there is little choice in exploration and pace. After 200 hours of The [Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3), this was definitely a change, but not strictly a bad one.

### Good

The game is very streamlined. I typically play open-world RPGs, where it's up to myself to figure out what to do next; The Last of Us holds my hand as if I was a little girl in a zombie apocalypse. All the leves are narrow corridors with the occasional side-channels (blocked by debris, naturally), seperated by slowly-opened doors or cutscenes. There is never any uncertainty on what to do and where to go. If you do happen to get stuck in a platformer puzzle, Ellie will be quick to point out to _maybe try that ladder over there_. All in all, it was a constant experience from start to finish and I had trouble putting the controller down.

### Bad

This one's really subjective. As an avid RPG fan, I definitely at times was left missing some freedom of exploration, at least outside the 10 meter corridor. Some scenery looked great — even for a remastered PS3 game — and I definitely would have liked to grind some coin and traverse it. Another consequence of a linear action game was the fatigue from having to clear area after area of bandits without break.

### Ugly

By the end I realized I was ugly. Zombies weren't the real danger. They're just mindless, well, zombies. The humans of the wasteland were the true enemy. And I was the worst. By the end of the game I had routinely crushed so many skulls in front of a young girl I was unsure if she remembered who the bad guys were. The bad guys definitely were just as misguided. In their conversations I was a mad murderer. I was forced to want to have the little girl all to myself. The game gave no choice of moral high ground, I was to murder by weapon and hand everyone coming my way, until the very end. It was pretty selfish of Joel, and I was left hoping for an alternative ending.
