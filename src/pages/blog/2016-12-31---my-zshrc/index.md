It is New Year‚Äôs Eve and I‚Äôm in bed fighting a cold, at the point where tweaking my _Terminal_ sounds productive. I wanted to share my minimal ZSH startup file in this _Gist_:

You can also find it pasted below, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it being up-to-date.

## What happens in my _.zshrc_?

First, we need to download the necessary plugins. I only use five:

* [Lean](https://github.com/miekg/lean) ‚Äî a nice, minimal theme
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) ‚Äî  Shows greyed-out suggestions while typing, and you can fill it in by pressing ‚Üí
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) ‚Äî This, well, highlights syntax
* [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search) ‚Äî Better history search
* [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) ‚Äî Completions for lots of programs‚Äô sub-commands

After downloading the plugins, they are sourced. The completions need to be setup separately. I also enabled case-insensitive completion because I can‚Äôt be bothered with _Folder Names_.

I also set up deduplicated history that persists between sessions. Since I mostly repeat the same 10 or so tasks with Terminal, _history_ combined with the _zsh-autosuggestions_ plugin saves me plenty of time.

Finally, I bind the ‚Üë/‚Üì to _history-substring-search_ for easier navigation, as well as set up an alias for _ls -l_.
